    <a>
    Shepherd's Pie recipes are traditionally done with lamb, 
    but are great with any ground meat--turkey and beef being the most popular 
    modern versions. Give this great casserole a try, and watch everyone flock to the table.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, halved</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup beef broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>4 cups frozen mixed vegetables</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup light sour cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place cubed potatoes and garlic in a large pot with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Brown ground beef over medium heat in a skillet. Stir in flour, mixing with beef drippings.</li>
        <li>Add beef broth, ketchup and vegetables. Stir to combine. Cook for 5 minutes, until thick.</li>
        <li>Transfer beef mixture into an oven-proof casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Drain potatoes and smash them a little bit before adding 1/4 cup of grated cheese and sour cream. Mash together until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spoon potatoes onto the middle of the meat mixture. With a fork, spread potatoes from the center to the edges to form the top layer.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup of grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until cheese is melted and golden. Let cool 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
